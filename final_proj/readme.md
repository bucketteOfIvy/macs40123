# Systemic Racism and Traffic Safety in New York City

This is the GitHub repository for a project exploring the relationship between lasting, historic, and ongoing systemic racism and traffic safety in New York. Our analysis is unique in that we are potentially the first zonal traffic analysis to consider more than just the risk of physical harm from a traffic crash, and in that we are one of the first quantitative studies to operationalize HOLC maps as reflections of lasting ideas about race and place. 

For those interested in reproducing our results, this repo is organized as follows:

- `data`: All data used for analyses. We've included many files in here, although a few will need to be generated by running scripts in the repo.

- `scripts`: The actual scripts used to generate our data. Prefixes indicate expected run ordering. While most scripts exclusively use Python, please note that `2_get_tract_features.R` is an R script, while `6_get_embeddings.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook intended to be ran in Google Colaboratory. Additionally, the scripts in `8_pcas` are intended to be ran on MidwaySSD, but should be able to modified and ran on many SLURM clusters.

- `notebooks`: A folder containing notebooks used for analysis. As of this time, all analysis has taken place in `analysis.ipynb` using helper functions in `helpers.py`.

- `figures`: Generated figures for our extended abstract.
